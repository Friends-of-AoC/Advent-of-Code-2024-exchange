# Advent of Code 2024 exchange

This repository is used to exchange ideas and code related to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)


## Join Advent of Code

1. Join **Advent of Code** [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/auth/login)
   * You can join with your Github account

## Choosing a Development Language / IDE

You will need an Editor of some sort. The recommendation is to use Visual Studio Code - it is lightweight and free and supports almost every development language.

Choose a language you would like to learn. If you have no idea at all which one to choose, here are safe choices:

* Java - Never can go wrong with this. Our key language for building services
* Javascript (Truescript) - There are some doubts whether this really is a programming language. You need it if you want to do Web development
* Python3 - Very universal. Can do anything on any platform. If you are interested in DevOps, try this

For the interested, there are some interesting background links

## How to Work with Git/GitHub

There are plenty of tutorials. A good starting point is the [GitHub Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)


## How to Work with this Project

0. **Create a free GitHub account:** https://github.com/signup
1. **Fork this project** into your own account
2. **Clone your forked project** to your local machine
3. Work in your editor and create the code for the exercise. 
   * In the folder `exchange` in the root of the project, you will find folders named `day01` to `day25`.
   * Go to the folder for the day's task you are working on. Inside the folder, you will find a README.md file with a link to the exercise for the day.
   * Create a folder within the day's task folder with your name (i.e. `exchange/day01/yourname`), and create any code within that folder. This folder will be uploaded later, your name identifies your solution for the task.
   * Write your cool code in the language of your choice in your named folder created in the previous step.
   * Once you are happy with the result, submit your answer for the day's task to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). Don't forget to complete the second part of the solution to get the *stars* ‚≠êÔ∏è for the day!
   * Share your code with the team, as explained in the next steps! üëç ‚≠êÔ∏è
4. **Commit** and **Push** your code to your fork. <br/>*This is just a fancy way of saying uploading your changes back to your Gitlab forked project.*
5. **Create a Pull-Request**. This will merge your solution into the upstream repository.
6. **Sync changes** from the original project take a look at the solution of others.
